**Before the episode starts**:
Work with the host to assign learners and 1 facilitator each to no more than 5 breakout rooms

***************************************
### 10:30? for 25 minutes

In this section:
- How can I cement my understanding of Git's functions?
- Rephrase Git commands using everyday language
- Demonstrate Git's functions by drawing or sketching

***************************************
### Introduce the activity

**5 minutes**

We've gone over a lot in the past __ hour(s) and it's easy to forget some of what you practiced. 
We're going to take some time to reinforce what you've already learned in smaller groups.

Each group will have about __ learners and one helper or instructor. You'll be in your group for about *15* minutes (depends on time)

Paste instructions into the Jamboard and review out loud:

In your group:
- You have two Git commands covered in the previous sections.
- Rephrase each Git command into everyday language; it doesn't need to be as pithy as the actual command.
- Try to draw or find an image for the action of each command.
- Record your work in your room's page of a Google Jamboard: 
  - https://jamboard.google.com/d/19dL_esijZW5_t4cBb8iCFB1gLJO_wIgHbohNc8sWop4/edit?usp=sharing
- When we come back together, we'll review the Jamboard
- Designate someone in your group to briefly comment on your Jamboard

Put a green check in Zoom Reactions when you have the Jamboard open.

*Check for questions*

Set a timer for 15 min, depending on available time - will need ~45 min for GHPages.

**5 min**

Share the Jamboard screen on Zoom and go through each page.
Ask each group to briefly comment - perhaps the facilitator if no one in the group wants to volunteer

***************************************
### Key points

- The language of Git can be confusing and intimidating
- Rephrasing commands and drawing concepts can clarify Git's workflow
