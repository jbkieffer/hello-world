- Questions
- Any Minitex wrap-up, including feedback survey

***************************************
### Use Cases for Git/GitHub in Libraries

If learners are interested:

#### Jamene use cases

- KU Carpentries Instructors website: https://kulibraries.github.io/carpentries-instructors/
  - Website hosted on GitHub pages for public notes from KU Carpentries Instructor meetings
  - Straightforward for others to take and post notes
  - Ability to PR means can limit write access to the repository
  - No need to involve KU IT for access to a web server
  - Less risk of inaccessibility than if hosted on Sharepoint
    - KU's Carpentries Instructor cohort includes folks not formally affilated with KU, which can make Sharepoint access difficult
- git-lego writing (log in to KU GitLab ahead of time)
  - in GitLab, which is similar to GitHub
  - use of Git/GitLab for collaborative work on a research project and academic paper
  - entire history of collaboration in the commit messages

#### Stephen use cases

TBD
